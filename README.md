# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404
### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
My estimate accuracy was generally moderate. While I was able to estimate simpler tasks like implementing basic features with reasonable accuracy, I often underestimated the time required for debugging, handling edge cases, and integrating components. Over time, I improved by breaking down tasks into smaller milestones and allocating extra time for unexpected challenges, which helped me create more realistic estimates.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
My estimate accuracy improved over the course of the subject as I gained more experience with the programming concepts and better understood the complexities of the tasks. Initially, I underestimated the time required for debugging and testing, but as I progressed, I started breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable components and factoring in additional time for potential challenges. This iterative learning process helped me provide more realistic and accurate time estimates by the end of the subject.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
From doing these estimates, I learned the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, well-defined components to better gauge their complexity. I also realized the need to account for unexpected challenges, such as debugging and testing, by adding a buffer to my estimates. Additionally, I learned that experience plays a key role in improving estimate accuracy, as repeated practice helped me better anticipate the time required for different types of programming tasks.


## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
From being reviewed by others, I learned the value of different perspectives in identifying areas for improvement in my code. Code reviews helped me spot issues I had overlooked, such as edge cases, inefficiencies, or deviations from best practices. I also gained a better understanding of how to write more readable and maintainable code by adhering to clear naming conventions, improving documentation, and following consistent formatting. Additionally, constructive feedback during reviews taught me to approach critiques positively and use them as opportunities for growth.


### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
From reviewing other people's code, I learned how to critically analyze code for readability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices. This process helped me identify common mistakes, such as unclear variable names, lack of comments, or redundant code, and apply these lessons to improve my own work. It also enhanced my understanding of alternative approaches to solving problems, exposing me to new techniques or methods I hadnâ€™t considered before. Additionally, providing constructive feedback improved my communication skills and reinforced the importance of collaboration in programming.

### Good Code Review 1
Prac 5 Code Review Request #2
### Explanation
In this review, I provided constructive advice on improving the readability of the code by suggesting better naming conventions for variables and functions. I also pointed out a potential edge case that might have caused unexpected behavior and offered a simple solution to handle it. The feedback was well-received and contributed to making the code more robust and maintainable.


### Good Code Review 2
Prac 09 feedback #5

### Explanation
In this review, I advised on simplifying a repetitive block of code by using a loop, which significantly improved efficiency and reduced redundancy. I also encouraged the use of inline comments to clarify the logic in a complex function, helping make the code easier for others to understand. My suggestions focused on enhancing the overall quality and maintainability of the project.
